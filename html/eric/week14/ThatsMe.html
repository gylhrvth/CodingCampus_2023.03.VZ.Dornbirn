        <p>
            In my free time i like to go to the gym on a daily basis, even though sadly i dont look like it yet.

        <br>

        <h4>Playing Video Games</h4>
        <p>
            Since my childhood i have been playing alot of video games, which kind of got me into the topic of IT
            and
            Software Engineering.<br>
            I mostly play FPS(First Person Shooter) games, one excample would be Counter Strike: Global Offensive,
            or
            Battlefield 4.<br>
            Even though i mostly play FPS games some of my favourite games, that i will always love playing are
            Monster
            Hunter World and Elden Ring. <br>
        </p>
        <br>

        <h4>Reading Books</h4>
        <p>
            I always really like to read Books. As a child i always used to read the comics from Duck Tales where i
            had a bunch of these books.<br>
            Nowadays i moreorlikely just read Phantasy Novels, Mangas and Manwuahs. Manga is like the japanese
            version of comics and Manwuahs the
            korean version of comics.
